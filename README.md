# Kanta_MinecraftVehicleProject
This is a small project I made a long time ago, using python to create a working car that responds to the wasd keys and changes directions using o and p. 
This only works with either the rasberry pi version of minecraft or minecraft forge 1.12.2 with a mod installed.
